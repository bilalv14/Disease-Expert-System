Bridging Disease Diagnosis and Expert System Development: 
An Integrated Approach

An extensive examination of disease diagnostics and expert 
system development is provided by this project. The project creates 
disease-symptom and symptom-disease mappings, builds a knowledge 
base, and creates an interactive diagnosis user interface by utilizing Python modules. This shows 
how AI approaches can be used practically in healthcare decision support systems by analyzing a 
dataset that includes diseases, symptoms, disease descriptions, precautions, and symptom 
severity
